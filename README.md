# DriveAge
The concept of our project DriveAge was born and conceptualised to satisfy the needs of all automobile fanatics out there who wish to have a place where they can find every minute detail associated with their favourite car at the mere click of a button. Theyâ€™ll have at their disposal an information page where they will not only be able to find the type, colour, price, fuel tank capacity, make, model, mileage, and seating capacity of vehicles delineated for them but also be able to compare them thoroughly in order to make informed decisions. Users can login to our website and contribute to the community blog in the form of suggestions, reviews, testimonials and much more. Even if someone wants to casually peruse through our website, they will find a plethora of news articles associated with latest updates on monthly sales, newest launches as well as car recalls amongst other things. DriveAge has a pleasing UI with a user-intuitive design so that even the most amateur of users can easily navigate through the website. The functionalities are created and structured in a way that combines form with function in the most efficient way possible, keeping user satisfaction as its priority.
